How to  Merge the main Branch into Your Current Branch
1.Switch to Your Branch: Make sure you are on your branch. You can switch branches in VS Code by clicking on the branch name in the bottom-left corner or by using the integrated terminal:
  git checkout your-branch-name
2.Fetch the Latest Changes: It's a good practice to fetch the latest changes before merging to ensure you have all the updates.
  git fetch
3.Merge main into Your Branch:
  git merge origin/main

After git merge origin/main
I have error: your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: please commit your changes or stash them before you merge

Stash Your Changes:
4.Open the integrated terminal and use the following command:
  git stash push -m "Descriptive message about what you're stashing"
This command stashes your changes and adds a message for context, which is helpful when you list stashes later.
5.Merge main into Your Branch: With a clean working directory, you can now merge:
  git merge origin/main
6.Resolve any conflicts if they occur during the merge,Reapply Your Stashed Changes, After the merge, you can bring back your stashed changes:
  git stash pop
This command applies the stashed changes back to your working directory. If there are conflicts between your stashed changes and the new state of the branch, youâ€™ll need to resolve them.
